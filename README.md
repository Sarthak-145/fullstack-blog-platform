A full-stack blog platform built with React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL.

The app supports user authentication, public and private routes, and complete CRUD
operations on posts with proper ownership rules. Authenticated users can create,
edit, and delete their own posts, while all users can read published content.

Built as a learning-focused project to understand real-world full-stack workflows,
including API design, protected routes, frontend state management, and deployment readiness.

## Features

- Public and protected routes
- Create, read, update, and delete posts
- Ownership-based access control
- Public post feed

### Notes for Contributors

This project was built as a learning-focused full-stack app.
_Clarity and simplicity are preferred over clever abstractions._

If you're adding something:

- Please don't fix comments, they are for me mostly
- Keep changes small and focused
- Follow existing patterns (services → controllers → routes)
- Avoid introducing unnecessary dependencies

I'm happy to discuss ideas before implementation.

If you're learning full-stack development, feel free to explore and experiment with this codebase.
